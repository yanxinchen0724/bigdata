    "text": "This project analyzes the afforestation results of China’s Three North Protective Forest Program to show the results of desertification reversal. Using high-resolution satellite data and random forest algorithms, the project tracks the greening process in depth, provides urban planners and environmentalists with accurate trend analysis, and visualizes the expansion of green space and ecological improvement.\n\n\nPrimarily for urban planners, environmental organizations, policy makers, and the public interested in greening change. Provides these users with detailed trends in de-desertification change\n\n\n\n\nHigh-resolution multispectral imaging data from Sentinel-2.\nValidation in conjunction with project-specific reports and statistics from the China Forestry Administration.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, a random forest algorithm is used to identify desert and greenfield cover to track and analyze the change process in a time series. This will involve training classifiers using labeled satellite imagery and cross-validating the models to ensure accuracy.\n\nSelection and preparation of the dataset Selection of satellite imagery: firstly, a suitable satellite image dataset needs to be selected from the GEE data catalogue. For greenfield analysis, images from the Sentinel-2 or Landsat series are good choices because they provide high-resolution and multispectral information suitable for identifying vegetation. And it is important to determine the time frame and geographic scope of the analysis. By setting specific dates and regions, the amount of data processed can be reduced and processing speed increased.\nPre-processing data Data Cleaning: Handles cloud cover and other factors that may affect image quality. gee provides a variety of tools and algorithms to automatically detect and remove cloud cover. Feature Selection: Based on multispectral images, select bands and indices such as Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) that are helpful in distinguishing greenfield and non-greenfield areas.\nTraining data preparation Collecting training samples: using the interactive map tool of GEE, manually select sample areas of greenfield and non-greenfield areas. These samples will be used to train the random forest model. Extraction of eigenvalues: Extract eigenvalues from the selected sample areas, including spectral values of the selected bands and other possible vegetation indices.\nTraining with Random Forest Define the model: define a random forest classifier in GEE and set appropriate parameters such as the number and depth of trees. Train the model: train the model using the prepared training dataset.GEE will handle the training process of the model and give a trained classifier.\nApply the model and analyse the results Classification full map: classify the image data of the whole study area using the trained random forest model and get the probability of each pixel belonging to green or non-green area\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction of the application(including background, policy, reference, and etc.) \nMap ：Comparing the coverage of green space and desert in different year/area \nAnalysis: Create trend graphs of forest coverage rate and total area changes on an annual basis.  \nLayers： Year/ coverage of green space and desert. \nLegend: desert - wasteland – forest ( classified by different density or related value) \nInterative experience 6.1 Custom target information \n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the link below with the link to your application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):\nMap.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);\n\nMap.setOptions(\"satellite\");\n\nvar aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);\nYou can include images:\n\n\n\nPixelwise T-Test, 2018\n\n\nand math: \\[ \\Large t = {\\frac{\\overline{x_1}-\\overline{x_2}} {\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} \\]"
